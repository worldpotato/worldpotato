### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm worldpotato and a student at the University of applied sciences Munich. Currently I'm doing the Master of Applied Research in Engineering Sciences with a focus on robotics, localization and mapping. I choosed this focus because I was interested in RC Cars/Drones/Robots since I was a small kid.

With these interests you can't get around ROS, which I really like. So I just managed to write my bachelorthesis about setting up a ROS system and also work with it in my master project.

With starting using ROS more and more I exchanged windows with linux on all my computers. At first I switched to ubunut but now I use Arch. You can find my dotfiles in my repositories.

Anyways, have fun digging in my repos, hopefully you can find something usefull!
